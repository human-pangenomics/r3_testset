# R3 Test Set

## Overview
- **42 HPRC (Year 2) samples**  
- Comprehensive sequencing data, including both trio and Hi-C for all samples  
- ONT data on both **R9** and **R10** flow cells, provided in separate index files:  
  - `R3_data_index_testset-ont_r9.csv`  
  - `R3_data_index_testset-ont_r10.csv`  
  -  **Please Note: only Y1-Y3 samples will have double ONT coverage (R9+R10).  Y4-Y5 samples will only have R10 data, so half the overall coverage of the Y1-Y3 samples.**
- DeepConsensus (DC) FastQs lack methylation calls; redundant HiFi BAMs are included for methylation analysis  
- R2 assembly locations included for reference  
- **Finalized dataset**: complete and will remain unchanged in Release 3  

## Purpose
This collection supports development and testing of assembly protocols for Release 3.
